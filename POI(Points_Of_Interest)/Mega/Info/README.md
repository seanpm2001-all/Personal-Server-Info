# Info on 2 new servers

I have been working on getting dedicated hard drives for domain-specific data purposes. I have decided on 2 hard drives for data from 2 companies.

Here are the plans:

## XDrive

**Basic description:** Separate HDD for Microsoft data (name is a portmanteu of XBOX and Hard Drive/OneDrive)

**To contain the following data:**

* Windows ISO images and Virtual machines

* OneDrive data

* GitHub data

* Windows Programs

## Google Drive

_Not to be confused with the online file service by Google of the same name, [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) I named it like this as a tongue-in cheek reference_

**Basic description:** Private and offline Google data - Separate HDD for Google data (name is a parody)

**To contain the following data:**

* Google Account backups (Total is currently: ~9 TB) + zip files (Total is now: ~18.1 TB)

* Android virtual machines (oh no, this might take up too much)

* Blockly and other Google Products

* APK archive data

***

## Fundraiser

Let's start a fundraiser for it: 60 TB HDD ($2350+)

[Option 1 (WARNING: Amazon.com link)](https://www.amazon.com/Mobius-5-Bay-FireWire-eSATA-Drive/dp/B077XKJ16G?th=1&psc=1)

60-80 terabyte option

Note:I have a preference for Western Digital, as they have been the most reliable for me. I have a strong bias against Seagate after a huge data failure and a drive failure within the first 5 minutes of plugging in an 8 terabyte external hard drive. It was my first Seagate hard drive, and I don't think I will ever buy from them again due to this.

**Total funds needed:** `$5000.00` | **Total funds raised:** `$0000.00`

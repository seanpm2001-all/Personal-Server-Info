# Hard drive 1AB-A points of interest

This is my third external hard drive. It is no longer in use (As of December 25th 2018) due to a severe crash, and instability. I am still unsure of what I lost when it crashed. It didn't work within 15 minutes of unboxing, and had to be de-commmissioned.

Use range: `December 25th 2018 to December 25th 2018`

Capacity: `8 Terabytes (8,000 Gigabytes (8,000,000 Megabytes (8,000,000,000 Kilobytes (8,000,000,000,000 bytes))))`

Provider: `Seagate`

Color: `Black`

Points of interest:

* None, all data was destroyed. Hard drive isn't functional

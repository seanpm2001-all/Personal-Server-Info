# Hard drive 1AB points of interest

This is my second external hard drive. It is currently in limited use, and is being used for legacy purposes, and for copying legacy data to newer drives.

Use range: `2016-present`

Capacity: `4 Terabytes (4,000 Gigabytes (4,000,000 Megabytes (4,000,000,000 Kilobytes (4,000,000,000,000 bytes))))`

Provider: `WD (Western Digital)`

Color: `Blue`

Points of interest:

* A copy of all the data from the original hard drive (1AA)

* Original Meadows prototype data

* A collection of early Linux ISO/RPM images (Ubuntu 4.10 to 20.04, Fedora Core 1-Fedora 28, Arch Linux (up to 2018 June) etc.)

* Most 2016/2017/2018 project data

* Some Google backup data

* Several early Windows 10 hard drive backups
